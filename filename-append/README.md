# Filename Append

This subproject focuses on making the filename available in the results Spreadsheet when
choosing to include a File Upload option on a Form.

Natively, Forms will populate a File Upload field with links to the uploaded files. While
this may be useful online, it is limiting when trying to work with Form outputs offline,
especially when attempting to attribute files to submitters. This issue grows in relevance
as the number of submissions grows.

The provided script, `FilenameAppend.gs`, will retrieve these filenames and append them in
a new field.

## How to Use

### Step 1: Generate the Results Spreadsheet

### Step 2: Attach the Script (Copy-Paste)

### Step 3: Initialize the Document Properties

### Step 4: Test with a Submission
